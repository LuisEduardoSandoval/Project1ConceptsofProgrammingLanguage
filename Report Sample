Data Structures Used:
I used a string to store in the text from the file of tokens. 
I will then iterate over the string making sure the tokens in the file are valid.

Pseudo-Code:
Function Name:  Scanner
input:  filename.txt
output: list of tokens in file
plan:
skip any initial white space (spaces, tabs, and newlines)
if cur char ? { plus( + ) , minus( - ) , times( * ) }
	return the corresponding single-character token
if cur char =  colon( : ) 
	read the next character
	if it is ‘=’ then return assign else announce an error
if cur char = ‘/’
	peek at the next character
if it is ‘*’ or ‘/’
	read additional characters until “*/” or newline is seen, respectively
	jump back to top of code
	else return div
if cur char =  period(.)
	read the next character
	if it is a digit
		read any additional digits
		return number
	else announce an error
if cur char is a digit
	read any additional digits and at most one decimal point
	return number
if cur char is a letter
	read any additional letters and digits
	check to see whether the resulting string is read or write
	if so then return the corresponding token
	else return id
else announce an error

Test Cases:

bar */
